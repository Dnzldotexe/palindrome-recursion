# palindrome-recursion
checking if a string is palindrome or not, but this time, I'll be using recursion. *wish me luck*

### OBJECTIVES:
- Write a recursive function that checks if a string is palindrome or not.
- Any empty string or containing one character is a palindrome.
- Any longer string is a palindrome is the first and last characters match.
- Display appropriate output to the user.

### NOTE:
- Clean the string first before applying the palindrome function.
